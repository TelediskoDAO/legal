    * 2.1.4 Upon rejecting a person as a new shareholder of DAO, DAO has no obligation to explain or justify such decision.
* 2.2. Accepting or rejecting a person as a new shareholder of DAO is in the competence of the management board and does not need a DAO vote.

* 2.3. A person shall be considered as a shareholder of DAO and a Shareholder in the meaning of this Agreement as of the day that person is entered in the shareholders' register of DAO.

* 2.5. The Shareholders commit to update their information in the shareholders´ register at least once a year and any other time whenever DAO deems it necessary. DAO shall have the right to take legal remedies against the Shareholders who are not collaborating in this respect.
3. **SHAREHOLDER CLASSES**
* 3.1. The Shareholders are divided into two classes with different rights and obligations pursuant to the Articles of Association of DAO, as follows:
    * 3.1.1. The Shareholders that are Investors;
    * 3.1.2. The Shareholders that are Contributors.
* 3.2. Each person becoming a Shareholder shall be considered as an Investor at first.

* 3.5. The Contributors are Shareholders with a right to participate in DAO votes and receive profit distributions by using tokens as allocation keys in accordance with the Articles of Association of DAO and this Agreement.
* 3.6. A Contributor who has not been fulfilling its rights and obligations with respect to DAO or has created mistrust, can be reversed into an Investor with a DAO vote. Mistrust includes, but is not limited to, risks related to money laundering, terrorist financing or international sanctions.
4. **TOKENOMICS**
* 4.1. A Shareholder´s contributions to DAO, made either in assets (e.g. money or crypto currency) or time, are rewarded with tokens. A Shareholder is rewarded with 1 token for every EUR 1 contributed. The value of a contribution in euros shall be decided with a DAO vote.
* 4.2. Tokens are not assets of DAO, unless acquired from a Shareholder or a third person.
* 4.3. Tokens are the units of measurement for the division of rights among the shareholders of DAO, that determine the right to participate in DAO voting and profit distribution pursuant to the Articles of Association of DAO and this Agreement.
* 4.4. The ownership or possession of tokens does not grant any rights or obligations related to DAO or the Shareholders to a person who is not a shareholder of DAO.
* 4.5. Tokens for contributed time shall be issued once a month. Tokens for contributed assets shall be issued as the contribution occurs.
* 4.6. DAO shall not be responsible for the tokens, and the risk associated with the tokens is fully transferred from DAO upon the initial issue of the tokens to a Shareholder.
* 4.7. There are never more tokens than there are contributions made into DAO, with the calculation of 1 token for EUR 1 contributed.
* 4.8. DAO shall have a voluntary Trustworthiness Reserve, filled with undistributed profit, which will amount to at least 30% of tokens with the calculation of EUR 1 per token. Use of Trustworthiness Reserve shall be decided with a DAO vote.
* 4.9. The Shareholders have agreed that only one personal secure blockchain address can be inserted to the shareholders' register (i.e. be whitelisted by DAO). The Shareholders shall not try to add blockchain addresses that are out of their control or otherwise contain crypto assets of multiple persons (e.g. incompatible exchange addresses, pooled addresses, incompatible custodial addresses). DAO has the right to double-check the fulfilment of this restriction at any time (e.g. by asking to do a back-and-forth test transaction). If a Shareholder needs to change its blockchain address inserted to the shareholders´ register, it shall submit an application to DAO that is going to vote over accepting or rejecting it.
* 4.10. Where undoubtably necessary (e.g. failure of blockchain), DAO may substitute tokens while correcting errors which have occurred with a DAO vote.
5. **GOVERNANCE OF DAO**
* 5.1. Although DAO is legally a normal private limited company with a compulsory management board, DAO is actually being managed with DAO votes.
* 5.2. The management board is obliged to execute all the lawful decisions taken with DAO votes.
* 5.3. The Shareholders have the right to appoint and remove the management board with a DAO vote.
* 5.4. Whenever any managing decision is needed, the management board shall call for a DAO vote instead of deciding on its own. The same applies where the need for a DAO vote derives from an external authority (e.g. from an auditor of DAO).
* 5.5. The Shareholders that are Investors have waived their right to call for DAO votes. Every Contributor has the right to call for a DAO vote whenever they deem it necessary. Contributors are prohibited from abusing that right (e.g. it is prohibited to call for DAO votes with potentially illegal outcomes or burden DAO with unnecessary DAO votes).
* 5.6. A DAO vote is formally initiated by the management board and its outcome is recorded by the management board, making it a legally binding decision of shareholders of DAO. Shareholders have agreed that a DAO vote is binding for DAO and Shareholders even if there are some formal shortcomings (e.g. it is missing a signature of a member of a management board) until the rights of the Shareholders are protected (e.g. the notice period and voting period times are followed) and the DAO vote does not need to be submitted to the authorities (e.g. Estonian commercial register).
* 5.7. Simple and routine decisions can be decided with negative DAO vote (i.e. a DAO vote is decisive over vetoing, not approving something).
* 5.8. A DAO vote is being taken on a platform provided by DAO. A DAO vote shall have a notification period and a voting period which are set out in the Articles of Association of DAO and depend on the importance of the decision (e.g. a DAO vote for a Christmas event has shorter periods compared to a DAO vote for a profit distribution).
* 5.9. Thresholds for the successful approval of a decision by a DAO vote are set in the Articles of Association of DAO.
* 5.10. DAO votes shall always take place online without convening actual meetings. Shareholders undertake not to call actual shareholders' meetings. If the shareholders' meeting is unavoidable pursuant to law, the meeting shall take place online.
* 5.11. In the event of a hack (i.e. intentional or unintentional misuse of blockchain that relates to the DAO operating system, including, but not limited to, blockchain transactions with tokens and DAO votes) all appropriate online functions of DAO shall be shut down to protect DAO. Management board of DAO shall take all the necessary measures to set up a temporary DAO voting capacity so that DAO can decide with DAO votes on the next steps. Such temporary DAO voting shall be based, as an exception, on the token allocation that took place in the morning of the beginning of the hack at 00:00:00 o´clock Estonian time. All blockchain related events, including, but not limited to, transactions with tokens, DAO votes, becoming or abandoning a shareholder´s status, from the time thereof are void unless DAO approves them afterwards. Advance notice periods for upcoming votings and voting periods themselves may be considerably shortened during the usage of temporary DAO voting capacity.
6. **REWARDING CONTRIBUTORS**
* 6.1. The Shareholders that are Contributors are rewarded with tokens for their time spent for the benefit of DAO.
* 6.2. Each Contributor shall be assigned a time unit that corresponds to 1 token by a way of a DAO vote. That assignment shall be based on a principle that 1 token represents time worth EUR 1.
* 6.3. The Contributors are obliged to track their time spent for DAO with a time tracking system designated by DAO. Only the time spent on tasks that are eligible for the respective project will be taken into account by DAO. In the beginning of each month, the eligible time spent by the Contributors during the previous month is added up and a DAO vote is called to approve the outcome. Upon a favourable DAO vote, corresponding tokens are issued to the Contributors´ blockchain address entered in the shareholders' register (i.e. whitelisted by DAO).
7. **VOTING RIGHTS**
* 7.1. Voting rights are not distributed evenly between the shareholders of DAO.
* 7.2. The Shareholders that are Investors have waived their right to vote. Consequently, only the Shareholders that are Contributors can participate in a DAO voting.
* 7.3. The Shareholders have agreed that tokens on the Contributors´ blockchain address entered in the shareholders' register (i.e. whitelisted by DAO) are counted as votes instead of shares of DAO.
* 7.4. The number of tokens being taken into account for a DAO vote and their allocation between Shareholders will be fixed on a day the DAO vote is announced. Subsequent transactions with tokens are not taken into account.
* 7.5. A Contributor may delegate its voting right only to another Contributor. Power of attorney shall be given via a platform provided by DAO. Only the power of attorneys existing before a DAO vote is announced shall be taken into account for the given DAO vote. Sub-delegating the received right to vote is not allowed. If the Contributor decides to participate in the DAO vote personally, the delegation is not taken into account for the given DAO vote.
8.  **RIGHT TO PROFIT DISTRIBUTION**
* 8.1. Rights to profit distribution are not allocated evenly among the shareholders of DAO.
* 8.2. The Shareholders have agreed that tokens on the Shareholders' blockchain address entered in the shareholders' register (i.e. whitelisted by DAO) are used as an allocation key instead of shares of DAO.
* 8.3. The number of tokens being taken into account for a profit distribution and their allocation between the Shareholders will be fixed on a day the DAO vote for the profit distribution is announced. Subsequent transactions with tokens are not taken into account.
* 8.4. The proportion of profit being distributed is decided with a DAO vote by taking into account the Articles of Association of DAO, including the rules concerning the Reliability Reserve.
* 8.5. Profit shall be paid out to Shareholders in crypto currency to their blockchain address that contained tokens which were taken into account in determining the distribution of profit among the shareholders of DAO.
* 8.6. Distribution of assets remaining upon liquidation shall be carried out by applying the rules for profit distribution.

* 9.1. Upon the need for an additional capital, a DAO vote shall decide the targeted amount and whether to make an open call or accept additional capital from a specific person.
* 9.2. The additional capital shall be transferred to DAO under investment agreements into the equity capital of DAO (during the time of signing this Agreement, the additional capital would go into the voluntary Liquidity Reserve). The Shareholders paying in additional capital shall not receive additional shares, but they will be rewarded with 1 token for every EUR 1 invested.
