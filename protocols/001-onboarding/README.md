# Onboarding a new Contributor

Definitions:

- **DAO**: teledisko DAO OÜ
- **Applicant**: an individual interested in joining *DAO*
- **Board Member**: a board member of *DAO*
- **Investor**: a KYC'd person that owns a share of the *DAO* (see [AoA](../../AoA.md))
- **Contributor**: an *Investor* that actively contributes to the *DAO* (see [AoA](../../AoA.md))


Process:

- *Applicant* is interested in becoming an *Investor*,
- *Applicant* downloads the application form ([docx](./application.docx), [odt](./application.odt)), compiles it and submits the form plus all require documents to the to a *Board Member* of *DAO*.
- A *Board Member* reviews the application to check if it's formally correct.
  - If the application has errors, it's rejected and the process stops here.
  - If the application is correct, the process continues.
- *DAO* enters the person into shareholders register and transfer a *DAO* share to *Applicant*.
- *DAO* submits the information of the new shareholder to the Estonian commercial register.
- *Applican* is now an *Investor*.
- At any time a *Contributor* proposes a "significant" resolution (6-day notice, 4-day voting) to change the *Applicant* status from *Investor* to *Contributor*. The resolution should include:
  - Who should be added as a contributor.
  - Why the *Applicant* should be promoted to contributor.
  - Which tier should be applied.
  - Any other important information that would help the DAO making an informed decision.
- If the resolution is rejected, *Applicant* stays an *Investor*.
- If the resolution passes:
  - *Applicant* status is set to *Contributors*.
  - *Applicant* is added to Odoo.
  - *Applicant* is added to Discord.
- The *Applicant* is now a *Contributor* ✨
